     <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess
of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for the magnificent lightship.
The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the su interact with the atmosphere in the Earth’s magnetic field. This relates energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

    <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country’s namesake—namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökulll and Svínafellsjökullglaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).
